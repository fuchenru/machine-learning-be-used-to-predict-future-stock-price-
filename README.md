_In order to build models to forecast the trajectory of stock prices, we need historical trading prices. We often claim that historical events are astonishingly similar, and this notion is essential for identifying the stock trend._

_In this study, I'm working under the premise that both the buyer and the seller determine the stock price, and that the trading price of a stock on a given day is influenced by many trading days prior to that trading day. This research's foundation is solely based on adaptive analysis, without taking into account any factors that affect the fundamental value. Such as Macroeconomics changing, idiosyncratic risk, and so on._

_Consequently, this research is a preliminary attempt to forecast the stock price. It seeks to show readers examples of how Python may be used for stock forecasting and not for any financial advice or recommendation._

_This research will be laid out in two parts. First, we will take a look at all the stock data and see if we can find any interesting story behind them. Then we will take a look at the correlation between them, just like what we studied in class. Second, we will use models to predict future prices. Because this class is intended to be an introduction class. I will not write the whole model from scratch. Instead, I found some quite useful package which is easier for readers to grasp an idea of how models work._
